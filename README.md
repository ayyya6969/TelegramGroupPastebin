# Telegram Pastebin with Docker

This project provides a simple web-based pastebin application integrated with Telegram. It allows you to post content from both a web interface and directly from a Telegram group using a specific command. Messages posted are stored in a local SQLite database and displayed on the web interface, with the ability to delete them from the web, which also removes them from Telegram.
